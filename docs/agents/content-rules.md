# Content Rules (Hard)

All content must:
- Be technically credible
- Be specific, not generic
- Teach before selling
- Avoid buzzwords unless explicitly defined
- Tie ideas back to real system outcomes

Banned language unless proven:
- “Revolutionary”
- “Game-changing”
- “Best in class”
- “Cutting-edge”
- "Guaranteed"
