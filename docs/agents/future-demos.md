# Future Demos (Planned)

This repo will later include a visitor-facing interactive demo that allows users to:
- Define their own AGENTS.md
- See how governance affects agent behavior
- Learn the difference between prompting and system design

Constraints:
- Read-only by default
- No persistence without explicit consent
- Strict separation from production logic

Agents may scaffold this only after the base site is stable.
