# Governance & Review

All agent-generated changes must:
- Be explainable
- Be reviewable via Git diff
- Have a clear reason for existence

If uncertain: Propose, do not execute.

## Guiding Principle
Systems beat prompts.
Governance beats vibes.
Quality is not optional.

This site should prove that.
