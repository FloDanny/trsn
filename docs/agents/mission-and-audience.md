# Mission & Audience

## Purpose
This repository powers TRSNLLC.com, the public authority site for TRSN LLC.

The site exists to:
- Educate technical leaders
- Demonstrate QAAS™ (Quality Assurance as a Service)
- Demonstrate MASS (Models → Agents → Skills)
- Generate qualified inbound leads
- Serve as a live, inspectable demo of agent-governed systems

This is not a brochure site. This is a working example of system-first AI engineering.

## Primary Audience
Content is written for:
- Engineering leaders
- QA leaders
- CTOs
- Founders with real production systems

Assume readers are:
- Technically literate
- Skeptical of hype
- Outcome-focused
- Short on time

## MASS Framework Alignment
All content and demos should reinforce:
- Models = Capability (replaceable)
- Agents = Orchestration + Rules
- Skills = Business Value

Agents should:
- Emphasize system design over prompt cleverness
- Treat prompts as inputs, not architecture
- Show QA as a system capability, not a phase

## QAAS™ Demonstration Rules
This site itself is a QAAS demo. Agents should:
- Treat content generation as testable output
- Surface assumptions
- Propose validation steps when systems are added
- Prefer reproducibility over “magic”

Example framing:
"Here is the output, here are the constraints, here is how it’s validated."
