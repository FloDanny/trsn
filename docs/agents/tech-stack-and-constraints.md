# Tech Stack & Constraints

## Locked Stack
- Framework: Next.js
- Rendering: Static-first, SSR only when justified
- Hosting: Vercel
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Content: MDX (Markdown + React)
- Forms: Server routes only
- Analytics: Passive, privacy-respecting

Agents must not introduce:
- WordPress
- Page builders
- Heavy client-side state for content pages
- Unapproved CMS platforms

## Explicit Non-Goals
This repo is not:
- A SaaS dashboard
- A marketing automation engine
- A playground for framework experiments
- An AI gimmick showcase
