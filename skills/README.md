# Skills

This directory contains Codex-native skills used by agents operating in this repository.

Each skill defines:
- When it should be used
- What authority it has
- What constraints apply
- What output shape is expected

Skills must comply with `AGENTS.md`.

If a task cannot be completed using existing skills, a new skill should be proposed.
